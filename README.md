 AI Social Media X Manager

A project I've been working on to explore how AI, automation and different APIs can come together to solve a practical problem.

The idea is simple: generate content with AI, review it through Telegram, and publish it to X without having to manually handle every step.

I built a web dashboard to manage the process, with a backend that handles content generation, storage, approval workflows and publishing.

# What it does

- Generates tweets, replies and content ideas using Google Gemini.
- Uses Google Search grounding to find relevant topics.
- Sends generated content to Telegram for review.
- Allows me to approve, reject or edit posts before publishing.
- Publishes approved content to X through Zernio.
- Stores content and tracks its status using PostgreSQL.
- Supports keyword management and automated content generation.

# Built with

- TypeScript
- React
- Node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Drizzle ORM
- Google Gemini
- Telegram Bot API (Telegraf)
- Zernio API
- Tailwind CSS

# How it works

1. Content is generated using Gemini.
2. The generated content is saved to the database.
3. A Telegram notification is sent with options to approve, reject or edit.
4. Once approved, the content is sent to Zernio for publishing.
5. The application tracks the content and its publishing status.

#A few things I learned

Working on this project gave me the opportunity to explore backend development beyond basic CRUD operations.

I've worked with external APIs, database operations, background tasks, asynchronous workflows and communication between different services.

There are still things I want to improve, particularly around authentication, testing, error handling and making the publishing workflow more reliable.

## What's next?

I'm continuing to improve the application, clean up the codebase and strengthen the underlying backend architecture.
